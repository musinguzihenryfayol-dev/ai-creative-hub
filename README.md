Portfolio Project Description: AI Creative Hub
Headline: AI Creative Hub – A Curated Multi-Modal AI Directory

The Challenge: With the explosion of AI tools, creators and students often face "analysis paralysis." I wanted to build a high-performance, searchable directory that provides genuine personal value through curated reviews and a seamless user interface.

Technical Highlights:

Data-Driven Architecture: Engineered a dynamic rendering system using Vanilla JavaScript that builds the UI from a centralized data object, allowing for instant updates without manual HTML editing.

Combinatorial Search & Filter: Implemented a complex filtering logic that allows users to combine text search and category filters simultaneously for a pinpoint user experience.

UX & Theming: Integrated a persistent Dark/Light mode system using CSS variables and localStorage, ensuring a personalized experience that respects user preferences.

Performance Optimized: Optimized for Core Web Vitals with lazy-loaded components and a "Zero-Framework" approach for lightning-fast load times.

Tech Stack: HTML5 | Modern CSS3 (Variables & Grid) | Vanilla JavaScript | Git/GitHub

"I’m excited to launch my latest project: AI Creative Hub! 🤖🎨

As a creator and student, I was tired of messy lists of AI tools. I built this hub to be a clean, fast, and curated space to find the best tools for video, music, coding, and more.

Built with Vanilla JS, featuring live search, smart filters, and my own personal reviews.
